# Receiver Comparison on 40m FT8 (7.074 MHz)

Here I summarize comparative tests between several receivers using the **same antenna system**.  
All experiments were performed in the shack, under the same RF environment (with local noise and interference present).  
The purpose was to evaluate practical FT8 decoding performance between **SDR** and **audio-output radios**.

---

## Antenna & Setup

- **Antenna**: Moonraker X1-HF (RX-only, up to 50 MHz)  
- **Coax**: ~15 m RG58 feedline  
- **Filters**: FM notch filter inline  
- **Ferrites**: 7 turns ferrite choke on pigtail, additional ferrite ~2 m before antenna  
- **Receivers tested**:  
  - RTL-SDR v3 (direct sampling)  
  - MiniATS V2  
  - MiniATS V3S  
  - Tecsun PL-660 (USB SSB mode, Wide filter)

All receivers were placed in the same shack position, using identical feedline and filtering.

## Methodology

- Frequency: **7.074 MHz (FT8)**  
- Duration: ~12 hours each run (late afternoon â†’ next morning)  
- Logs collected via **WSJT-X** (`ALL.TXT`)  
- Decodes, SNR statistics, and unique calls/grids were analyzed.  
- Tests were conducted on the same day but sequentially, so propagation changes during the period may affect the comparison.

## Observations

- **RTL-SDR v3** clearly outperforms the others in sheer number of decodes/hour. IQ sampling at baseband avoids the limitations of narrow audio filters and AGC behavior.  
- **MiniATS V2** shows the best results among the audio-output radios.  
- **MiniATS V3S** is slightly behind the V2 in both decodes/hour and average SNR.  
- **Tecsun PL-660**, despite being a portable analog receiver, matches the MiniATS class closely, and even showed the **highest maximum SNR (+21 dB)** observed in the tests.  

---

## Conclusions

- With identical antenna and feedline, **all audio-output radios (MiniATS, PL-660)** provide roughly similar decoding performance.  
- The **PL-660** holds its ground very well: ~35k decodes overnight, 1311 unique calls, 548 grids, only slightly behind MiniATS.  
- The **RTL-SDR v3** remains the strongest performer due to its ability to feed full IQ data to WSJT-X, offering a wider decode window and higher density of signals.  

ðŸ“Œ **Final takeaway**:  
- For serious monitoring/logging: RTL-SDR v3 is superior.  
- For portable/standalone use: MiniATS and PL-660 deliver excellent results considering their simplicity and form factor.

- Steinberg UR-22C used as sound card. Input gain and receiver volume were tuned to match ~40 dB on WSJT-X.  
- WSJT-X v2.7.0 for decoding  

### Decoding Performance
| Receiver      | Total Decodes | Duration (min) | Decodes/min | SNR min | SNR max |

|---------------|-------------:|---------------|--------------:|
| Tecsun PL-660 | 328          | RI16          | 14,473        |
| MiniATS V2    | 258          | PB12          | 14,280        |

The Tecsun not only decoded more signals overall, but also reached more unique locations and slightly farther DX.

### Conclusion
On the 10 m band (28.074 MHz), the **Tecsun PL-660 outperformed the MiniATS V2** in every measured aspect:
- Higher decode rate per minute  
- Broader SNR coverage  
- Wider geographical spread with more unique grids and longer DX  
- More stable performance across time  

While the MiniATS V2 remains usable, it consistently lagged behind the Tecsun in weak-signal reception and throughput under identical test conditions.  

**Overall:** the Tecsun PL-660 demonstrated stronger performance in weak-signal FT8 reception on 28 MHz compared to the MiniATS V2.  

*Note: All tests were conducted with an external, roof-mounted antenna. Performance may vary with telescopic or other antenna types.*

### Overall Takeaway  
  
Overall, RTL-SDR v3 remains the most powerful option for dense FT8 decoding.  
  
For shack use and digital mode decoding, the RTL-SDR v3 is clearly the first choice.  
  
For field use, voice reception and ease of use, the Tecsun PL-660 stands out: reliable, user-friendly, with a large display, dedicated buttons, and strong, high-quality audio.  
  
For portability, the MiniATS series shines. Despite its small size, it does not lack features - on the contrary, with existing firmwares it can even decode RTTY/CW natively.  
It offers good battery autonomy with a built-in lithium cell, headphone output (V1 is missing headphone amplifier that is present to next versions), and in V3/V3S models, a High-Z antenna input.  
The MiniATS is a tiny yet capable receiver with a color display, ideal for lightweight portable operation.
