# 📻 V3S JFET Power Supply Noise Investigation

This document summarizes the investigation of the **AMNVOLT MiniATS V3S** power supply for the JFET (K51G) input stage, comparing the original rail with a new feed from the **SI4732 Pin 10**.

## 🔧 Mod Overview

- Original design powered the **JFET** from a noisy rail influenced by the OLED backlight PWM.  
- Initial trials included a **22 Ω series resistor** and **local decoupling (100 nF + 10 µF)**.  
- Final configuration shown here uses **direct feed only (no resistor, no capacitors, as Peter suggests)**.  
- Comparisons were made with the **Screen ON** and **Screen OFF**.

## 📐 DC Bias

- **SI4732 Pin 10:** 3.3207 V  
- With 22Ω in series (initial test): **3.2194 V** at JFET side → ~101 mV drop (≈4.6 mA current).  

*(The series resistor was later removed for final tests.)*

## 📊 Time-Domain Noise (Oscilloscope)

**Settings:** AC coupling, BW limit 20 MHz, probe ×10.

### Old Line (original rail)
- RMS ≈ **18–20 mV**  
- Pk–Pk ≈ **70–80 mV**  
- Strong periodic disturbances (PWM-related).

---

### New Line (SI4732 pin 10)
- RMS ≈ **3–4 mV**  
- Pk–Pk ≈ **16–30 mV**  
- Much quieter baseline.

### Screen OFF
- Noise reduces further with backlight off.  
- Confirms display PWM as an additional noise source.

## 📉 FFT Analysis

**Settings:** FFT, Hanning window, span ≈ 0–200 kHz.  

### Old Line
- Clear tones around **10–20 kHz** and harmonics.  
- Higher noise floor.

### New Line (SI4732 pin 10)
- Noise floor reduced by ~10–15 dB.  
- PWM peaks suppressed; screen OFF → nearly flat spectrum.

## ✅ Conclusion

- Powering the JFET from **SI4732 pin 10** significantly lowers supply noise at the High-Z input stage:  
  - **Old rail:** ~18–20 mV RMS  
  - **New rail (direct):** ~3–4 mV RMS  
- FFT confirms suppression of PWM harmonics from the OLED display.  
- Even without RC filtering, SI4732 pin 10 provides a **much cleaner supply**.
- Next step is to **reinstall RC filter** (22Ω registor and decoupling capacitors 100nF & 10μF).

## 🔍 PCB View of the Mod

The following picture shows the **Amnvolt V3S PCB** with the applied modification.  
The JFET (K51G) no longer takes power from the original noisy rail (it's lifted up), but is instead connected directly to **SI4732 Pin 10** .  
This ensures the Hi-Z input stage receives a cleaner supply.
