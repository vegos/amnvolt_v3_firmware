# Noise & Supply Measurements ‚Äì AMNVOLT MiniATS V3S

Supply voltages and noise behavior of the AMNVOLT MiniATS V3S were checked, focusing on the **JFET input stage (High-Z circuit)**.

Two alternative supply sources were tested:  
- From the **SI4732 VDD_RF (pin10)**  
- From the **main power switch output**  

The JFET under test is marked **K31G** in SOT-23 package.  

üëâ Measurements were taken at the **Drain pin (pin 2)**.

## üìä Ripple / Noise Measurements

| Test Point             | Pk‚ÄìPk Noise | RMS Noise | Dominant Frequency | Observations |
|-------------------------|-------------|-----------|--------------------|--------------|
| **JFET Drain (pin 2)** | ~17.6 mVpp  | ~1.4 mV   | ~9.3 Hz (PWM spur) | Cleanest line, minimal ripple, best candidate for Hi-Z stage supply. |
| **SI4732 VDD_RF (pin10)** | ~63 mVpp   | ~10 mV    | ~9.7 Hz (PWM), plus higher harmonics | Appears visually flat due to local decoupling, but periodic dips from display PWM raise overall noise. |
| **ON/OFF switch output** | ~72 mVpp   | ~12 mV    | ~9.8 Hz (PWM backlight) | Noisiest, shows direct impact of IPS backlight PWM and ESP32 activity. |

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Note: The screenshots may look counter-intuitive at first glance.  
> The **JFET Drain (pin 2)** shows a more visible ripple pattern (~72 mVpp), while the **SI4732 VDD_RF (pin10)** looks flatter due to stronger local decoupling.  
> Numerically, however, the SI pin10 rail has significantly lower ripple (~17 mVpp).  
> This is why the trace of the SI supply appears ‚Äúquiet‚Äù on the scope, while the JFET drain reveals more periodic ripple from the backlight PWM.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

- The **JFET Drain supply** is the cleanest option and the most suitable for powering the Hi-Z input stage.  
- The **SI4732 pin10** supply is acceptable but carries periodic PWM artifacts from the display.  
- The **ON/OFF switch output** is the noisiest and should be avoided for sensitive analog/RF stages.
