# JFET Supply Modification and Noise Measurements

This modification is based on the excellent work by **Peter Neufeld (DB9JG)**.  
See his detailed write-up here: [Si4732A MiniRX Modifications](https://peterneufeld.wordpress.com/2025/06/13/si4732a-minirx-modifications/).

## üîß The Mod

The goal is to improve the supply quality for the JFET (K51G), which originally was fed from a noisy rail.  
The modification consists of:

- Cutting the old supply line.
- Feeding the JFET from the **SI4732 VDD_RF (pin10)** through a **22Œ© resistor**.  
- Adding **decoupling capacitors** close to the JFET:
  - 100 nF ceramic  
  - 10 ¬µF ceramic  

This provides the JFET with a cleaner supply, leveraging the already well-decoupled SI4732 rail.

## üìè Voltage Measurements

Initial DC measurements showed the expected drop across the series resistor:

- **SI4732 pin 10**: 3.3207V  
- **JFET (after 22Œ© resistor)**: 3.2194V  

The ~100 mV drop confirms current flow through the resistor and defines the bias for the JFET.

## üìâ Oscilloscope Measurements

All measurements taken with:

- **Siglent SDS1202X-E oscilloscope**
- AC coupling, √ó10 probe
- Bandwidth limit: 20 MHz
- Horizontal scale: 20 ms/div  
- Vertical scale: 20 mV/div

### Old Feed (before the mod)

![Old Feed](./images/SDS00014.png)  

- Supply from the original rail.  
- Strong PWM ripple visible, peak-to-peak ~78 mV, RMS ~18 mV.

### SI4732 Pin 10

![Si4732 Pin 10 Feed](./images/SDS00015.png)  

- Direct measurement on VDD_RF.  
- Much quieter line: p-p ~26 mV, RMS ~3.7 mV.

### JFET (with 22Œ©)

![JFET with 22Œ©](./images/SDS00016.png)  

![JFET with 22Œ©](./images/SDS00017.png)  

- Ripple reduced compared to old feed.  
- RMS ~3.8 mV, peak-to-peak ~26‚Äì30 mV.  
- Clean trace, minimal coupling of the backlight PWM.

### JFET (bypassing the 22Œ©)

![Bypassing the 22Œ© to JFET](./images/SDS00018.png)  

- Similar RMS noise (~3.9‚Äì4.0 mV).  
- Slightly larger peaks than with resistor.  
- The 22 Œ© helps isolate local decoupling and smooth out spikes.

## üìä Comparison Table

| Measurement Point          | Peak-to-Peak | RMS Noise | Notes                                   |
|----------------------------|--------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------|
| Original JFET Supply       | ~78 mV       | ~18 mV    | Strong PWM ripple                       |
| SI4732 Pin 10              | ~26 mV       | ~3.7 mV   | Very clean, well-decoupled               |
| JFET w/ 22Œ©                | ~26‚Äì30 mV    | ~3.8 mV   | Clean, resistor helps decoupling         |
| JFET w/o 22Œ©               | ~25‚Äì30 mV    | ~3.9‚Äì4.0 mV| Still clean, slightly more spiky ripple |

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

Feeding the JFET from the **SI4732 pin 10** provides a much cleaner supply compared to the original rail.  
Adding a **22Œ© resistor with local decoupling capacitors (100nF + 10¬µF)** offers the best compromise:  
- Lower RMS noise (~3.8 mV vs ~18 mV original).  
- Reduced ripple coupling from the display PWM.  

This ensures the JFET preamp delivers a cleaner RF signal to the SI4732, improving overall reception quality.
