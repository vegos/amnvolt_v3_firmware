Backup of stock AMNVOLT V3 Mini Si4732 Radio ESP32-S3 Pocket Radio firmware.
It doesn't had an about page or information about the programmer and where to find this version or future versions.


I bought it from Banggood, with that description:

AMNVOLT mini SI4732 full-band DSP radio, receiver, pocket radio, supports FM AM (MW and SW) and SSB (LSB and USB) modes, upgraded version, built-in headphone amplifier circuit.

Note: If the encoder is stuck after receiving the product, it may be due to the long transportation time, which has caused the lubricant to dry out. It is recommended to remove the cap and add lubricant before use.

Advantages of upgrade:

1. Brand-new hardware structure, adding independent headphone amplifier circuit, solving the problem of low headphone volume in the first generation.
2. Brand-new system: Added screen brightness adjustment function, worry-free outdoor use; added quick access to volume adjustment page function; added power digital display function; added bandwidth adjustment function, etc.
3. High-quality production process: Some manufacturers mix inferior accessories in the old version, and we use all new parts for production

4. Add Build-in HIZ. (Delivery after the end of May only)
