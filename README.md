## 🔧 Usage

This firmware can be flashed back to a compatible V3 unit using:

```bash
esptool.py --chip esp32s3 --baud 921600 write_flash 0x000000 "Mini ATS V3 - original-flash-1.01.bin"
```

or with other tools...

It's very well documented the flashing or backing up procedure!


## 📂 Roadmap

We plan to:

- [ ] Analyze and map memory partitions (`binwalk`, `uvx`)
- [ ] Extract SPIFFS or other resource sections (if available)
- [ ] Provide unpacked firmware components (e.g. `firmware.bin`, `spiffs.img`)
- [ ] Document firmware capabilities and limitations vs open source builds (e.g. [`ats-mini2`](https://github.com/jumbo5566/ats-mini2))

## 🔗 Related Firmware Project

The factory firmware (v1.01) appears to be based on or derived from [G8PTN's ATS_MINI project](https://github.com/G8PTN/ATS_MINI), which provides a minimal implementation of the ATS receiver using ESP32-S3 and the SI4732.

> 📌 G8PTN confirms that some units with the Hi-Z front-end exhibit **battery drain even when powered off**, due to a design issue where the power to the JFET buffer is not properly switched.  
> See: [this discussion with annotated image](https://github.com/G8PTN/ATS_MINI/discussions/106) for more details.

This hardware modification involves cutting a factory trace and rerouting it through a switch-controlled line to avoid leaving the front-end MOSFET permanently powered.

## ⚠️ Known Hardware Issue: Battery Drain on V3 Units

Several users have confirmed that **AMNVOLT Mini V3** units with the **Hi-Z input circuit** and headphone amplifier may experience significant **battery drain**, even when turned off.

### 🧠 Cause
The issue is related to a design flaw where a power trace feeds voltage directly to the **JFET buffer** or associated front-end circuitry without being properly switched off. This keeps a transistor partially powered at all times.

### 🔧 Community Workaround
To fix this, users have applied a **hardware modification** by:

- Scraping a specific via and soldering a **0-ohm resistor** to bypass or reroute the trace to a switched voltage point.
- Avoiding the method of lifting transistor legs, which may harm RF performance or bypass critical filtering.

> This issue does **not affect earlier V2 units**, which seem to have proper power gating for the front-end.

## 🔋 Experimental Verification (V2 vs V3 battery drain)

After fully charging at the same time and leaving both units powered off for 24 hours:

| Device | Voltage after 24h OFF | Notes |
|--------|-----------------------|-------|
| V2     | 4.21 V                | No drain observed — battery remains full |
| V3     | 3.99 V                | Battery drain confirmed — ~0.2 V drop overnight |

This confirms that the V3 unit suffers from a measurable standby drain even when powered off, consistent with the known issue described above.  
A hardware modification is advised if long-term standby retention is important.

I'm working on a proper design without cutting traces, by removing parts and reconnect them correctly.

## 🛠️ My Hardware Mod to Prevent Battery Drain

A hardware modification was performed to disconnect the drain pin of the transistor from the PCB (lift the drain pin of the transistor), insulate it using kapton tape and rewire it so it receives power only when the device is switched on.

Procedure

Identified the transistor responsible for drain (K51G) and verified continuity with the battery + terminal. 
Tried desoldering the component without hot air due to 3D printed enclosure constraints.
Lifted the drain pin enough to fit insulation under it (kapton tape).
Soldered a jumper wire from the drain pin to a nearby VCC pad that is active only when the power switch is on. That's the power switch.
Verified the modification by checking that no current is drawn when the device is turned off.
Confirmed the device still works fully — including receiving FT8 signals — after the modification.

Notes

RF performance remains unaffected.
This method was chosen over PCB trace cutting due to being less invasive and more easily reversible. It doesn't need to cut any traces etc.
Similar mods have been performed by other users, and documented online.
